Data and scripts from the entropy-core evolution project
========================================================

This documentation complements the GitHub repository with data and scripts by providing minimal
examples to help you **include data from Altamura et al. (2025) in your figures in no time.**

Check out the :ref:`properties`, :ref:`profiles`, :ref:`lagrangian_histories`, and
:ref:`projected_maps` sections of the documentation for minimal
Python examples to read in and plot the data from our paper directly into your figures.

Each section describes the serialisation of the data, the file structure, and provides abstract
I/O functions to read data from file.

.. note::

    If using these results, data or scripts in your work, please consider citing Altamura et al.
    (2023), Altamura et al. (2025) and the PhD thesis Altamura (2023). Visit the
    :ref:`citing` for more information.
